# Churn Analysis Project

This project demonstrates a **Churn Analysis** process using **SQL Server**, **Power BI**, and **Python**. The goal is to identify customer churn patterns, clean and process the data, build a machine learning model, and visualize the results for business decision-making.

## Project Overview

In this complete **Churn Analysis** project, we cover a range of topics including data extraction, transformation, visualization, and predictive modeling. The steps in the project include:

1. **ETL Process in SQL Server**  
   We start with the **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** process using **SQL Server**. This step involves extracting raw data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a data warehouse for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning in SQL Server**  
   Data is cleaned in **SQL Server** by handling missing values, duplicate records, and ensuring consistency across datasets. This process is crucial to ensure the accuracy and quality of the data before further analysis.

3. **Power BI Transformations**  
   In **Power BI**, transformations are applied to the cleaned data to prepare it for visualization. Data is structured in a way that makes it easy to perform detailed analysis and insights extraction.

4. **Power BI Visualization & Enhancing Visuals**  
   The transformed data is visualized using **Power BI**. This step involves creating interactive dashboards and reports to showcase the customer churn patterns and other relevant insights. We enhance visuals by applying advanced formatting techniques to ensure clarity and impact.

5. **Build Machine Learning Model - Random Forest in Jupyter Notebook**  
   In this stage, we build a **Random Forest machine learning model** in **Jupyter Notebook** to predict customer churn. The model is trained on historical data to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of customers churning.

6. **Visualize Predicted Data in Power BI - Predicted Churner Profile**  
   After the machine learning model generates predictions, the results are visualized in **Power BI**. The predicted churner profiles are displayed, helping businesses identify which customers are at risk of leaving, enabling timely intervention strategies.

## Key Features:
- ETL and data cleaning using **SQL Server**.
- Data transformations and reporting in **Power BI**.
- Machine learning model creation using **Python** (**Random Forest**).
- Predictive analytics visualized in **Power BI**.
- Interactive dashboards for business decision-making.

## Technologies Used:
- **SQL Server** for ETL and data cleaning.
- **Power BI** for data transformations, visualizations, and reporting.
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook) for building the **Random Forest** machine learning model.
- **Random Forest** algorithm for churn prediction.

## How to Run the Project:

### Prerequisites:
1. Install **SQL Server** for data storage and ETL processing.
2. Install **Power BI** for data visualization and reporting.
3. Install **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** for building and testing the machine learning model.
4. Install the following Python libraries:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `seaborn`

### Steps:
1. **ETL Process**: Set up and run the ETL scripts in SQL Server to prepare the data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data within SQL Server.
3. **Power BI**: Load the data into Power BI, apply transformations, and create interactive reports and dashboards.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: Use the Jupyter Notebook to build and train the **Random Forest** model for churn prediction.
5. **Visualization**: Import the prediction results back into Power BI and create visualizations for the churner profiles.

## Future Improvements:
- Implement additional machine learning models to compare performance.
- Add more granular customer segmentation to predict specific churn patterns.
- Improve data preprocessing and transformation techniques.
